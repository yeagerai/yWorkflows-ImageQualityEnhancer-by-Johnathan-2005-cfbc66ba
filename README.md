# ImageQualityEnhancer

A workflow that enhances the quality of an input image. The workflow provides the user with an interface to upload an image file, extracts relevant features like brightness, contrast, color balance, and sharpness, uses a pre-trained image enhancement neural network to suggest edits that can improve the image quality, and generates a side-by-side comparison of the original and enhanced images.
## Initial generation prompt
A workflow named ImageQualityEnhancer that performs the following steps: 1. First, a component that provides a user interface to upload an image file. 2. Then, a component that processes the uploaded image and extracts relevant features, such as brightness, contrast, color balance, and sharpness. 3. Next, a component that uses an AI model (e.g., a pre-trained image enhancement neural network) to analyze the extracted features and suggest edits that can improve the image's quality. 4. After that, a component that applies the suggested edits to the image and generates a preview of the enhanced image. 5. A component that presents the user with a side-by-side comparison of the original and enhanced images, along with the specific edits that were applied. 6. Finally, a component that allows the user to download the enhanced image or make additional manual adjustments to fine-tune the results.
