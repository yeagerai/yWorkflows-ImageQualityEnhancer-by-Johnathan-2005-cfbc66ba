# Component Name

Error

## Description

The Error component is a building block of a Yeager Workflow designed to handle and process error events. This component simulates an error and can be useful for testing error handling within your workflow.

## Input and Output Models

The input and output data model for the component is a dictionary which can contain any data you would like to pass through the workflow.

### Input Model

- `data` (dict): The input dictionary that you would like to pass to the Error component.

### Output Model

- `output` (dict): The same input dictionary that you provided to the component is returned as-is with no modification.

## Parameters

This component does not have any user-defined parameters.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` method of the Error component is implemented as follows:

1. Raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "Simulated Error".
2. Due to the raised `RuntimeError`, the error handling mechanism within the Workflow is triggered, allowing you to debug and test error handling capabilities for your workflow.

## External Dependencies

This component does not have any external dependencies.

## API Calls

There are no API calls made by the Error component.

## Error Handling

The component intentionally raises a RuntimeError exception with the message "Simulated Error" to simulate an error event, which triggers the error handling mechanism within the Workflow.

## Examples

To use the Error component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Import the Error component:
