# Component Name
ComparisonPresenter

# Description
This component is designed to create a side-by-side comparison image from two input images (original and edited) and generate an edit summary from a list of applied edits.

# Input and Output Models
The component uses the following input and output data models for validation and serialization:

- **ComparisonPresenterInputDict**: A `BaseModel` class that validates and serializes the input data for the component. It includes the following attributes:
  - `original_image`: A bytes object representing the original image.
  - `edited_image`: A bytes object representing the edited image.
  - `edits`: A list of strings representing the edits applied to the original image.

- **ComparisonPresenterOutputDict**: A `BaseModel` class that validates and serializes the output data for the component. It includes the following attributes:
  - `comparison_image`: A bytes object representing the side-by-side comparison image.
  - `edit_summary`: A string representing the summary of edits applied to the original image.

# Parameters
The `ComparisonPresenter` component does not have any configurable parameters.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` function performs the following steps:

1. Load the original and edited images as `PIL.Image` objects using `BytesIO` for in-memory management.
2. Create a new blank `PIL.Image` object with double the width of the input images and the same height.
3. Paste the original and edited images side-by-side on the new blank image.
4. (Optional) Add labels to the original and edited images. This step may require additional image processing libraries like PIL or OpenCV.
5. Create an edit summary string from the list of applied edits.
6. Store the resulting comparison image in a bytes object.
7. Return the `ComparisonPresenterOutputDict` object containing the combined comparison image and the edit summary string.

# External Dependencies
The component relies on the following external libraries:

- `fastapi`: Used to create the FastAPI application and endpoint for the component.
- `pydantic`: Provides the `BaseModel` classes for input and output validation and serialization.
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library): Used to manipulate and process the image data.

# API Calls
There are no external API calls made by the component.

# Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly implemented in this component. Errors related to invalid input data will be caught by the Pydantic BaseModel classes, and other errors will raise native Python exceptions.

# Examples
To use the `ComparisonPresenter` component within a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Import the `ComparisonPresenter` class and necessary data models:
