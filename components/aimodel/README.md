# Component Name

AIModel

# Description

The AIModel component is a part of a Yeager Workflow, designed to use a pre-trained model to process input features and return suggested image edit operations based on the input features. It inherits from the AbstractComponent base class.

# Input and Output Models

The component uses two Pydantic BaseModel classes:

* `AIModelInputDict`: Contains the input data consisting of a list of float values representing the image features.
* `AIModelOutputDict`: Contains the output data consisting of a list of suggested image edit operations as strings.

Both classes serve to validate and serialize the inputs and outputs of the component.

# Parameters

The component has the following parameters:

* `pre_trained_model_path`: A string indicating the path to the pre-trained model file.

# Transform Function

The `transform` function processes the input data and returns the suggested image edit operations:

1. Converts the input image features into a PyTorch Tensor and unsqueezes it.
2. Passes the image features to the pre-trained model, obtaining an enhancement map.
3. Processes the enhancement map to extract suggested image edit operations.
4. Returns the suggested image edit operations as an instance of `AIModelOutputDict`.

# External Dependencies

The component uses the following external libraries:

* `os`: To access environment variables and paths.
* `typing`: For type hinting and annotations.
* `pydantic`: For input and output validation and serialization.
* `fastapi`: For creating a FastAPI app and defining an endpoint.
* `dotenv`: To load environment variables.
* `yaml`: To read and manipulate configuration data.
* `torch`: To handle model loading and processing.

# API Calls

There are no external API calls made by the component.

# Error Handling

The AIModel component does not have specific error handling. Errors related to invalid inputs or issues with the pre-trained model will propagate as regular Python exceptions.

# Examples

Using the AIModel component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Define the input features as a list of float values:
