# AIModel

Receives image features from FeatureExtractor, and uses a pre-trained image enhancement neural network to analyze them, suggesting edits that can improve the image quality. Outputs the suggested edits.

## Initial generation prompt
description: Receives image features from FeatureExtractor, and uses a pre-trained
  image enhancement neural network to analyze them, suggesting edits that can improve
  the image quality. Outputs the suggested edits.
input_from: FeatureExtractor
name: AIModel


## Transformer breakdown
- 1. Load pre-trained image enhancement neural network model from specified path.
- 2. Pass the input image features to the neural network model to generate an enhancement map.
- 3. Process the enhancement map to extract suggested image edit operations.
- 4. Return the list of suggested edit operations as output.

## Parameters
[{'name': 'pre_trained_model_path', 'default_value': 'default_model.pth', 'description': 'Path to the pre-trained image enhancement neural network model file.', 'type': 'str'}]
