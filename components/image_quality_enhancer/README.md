# Component Name

ImageQualityEnhancer

# Description

The `ImageQualityEnhancer` component is a Yeager Workflow component that takes an `UploadedImage` as input and returns an `EnhancedImage` after performing image enhancement operations. The enhancement operations are applied as part of the inherited `AbstractWorkflow`'s transform() method.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

- UploadedImage: A Pydantic BaseModel class with the following attributes:
    - content (str): The content of the image
    - filename (str): The name of the uploaded file
    - format (str): The format of the image (e.g., JPEG, PNG)

## Output Model

- EnhancedImage: A Pydantic BaseModel class with the following attributes:
    - content (str): The content of the enhanced image
    - edits_summary (List[str]): A list of strings summarizing the performed edits on the image
    - filename (str): The name of the enhanced image file
    - format (str): The format of the enhanced image (e.g., JPEG, PNG)

# Parameters

## ImageQualityEnhancer Class Parameters

No additional parameters are used in the constructor of the `ImageQualityEnhancer` class.

## Transform Function Parameters

- args (UploadedImage): An instance of the UploadedImage class, representing the input image
- callbacks (typing.Any): A helper parameter for handling callbacks; defaults to None

# Transform Function

The transform() method performs the following steps:

1. Override the AbstractWorkflow's transform() method and call it with the provided args and callbacks
2. Unpack the results_dict returned from the parent transform method
3. Extract the enhanced image content, performed edits summary, enhanced image filename, and enhanced image format from the results_dict
4. Create an instance of the EnhancedImage model with the extracted data
5. Return the EnhancedImage instance

# External Dependencies

The component has the following external dependencies:

- `typing`: Used for type hinting
- `dotenv`: Used to load environment variables
- `fastapi`: Web framework for building APIs, used in this component for creating a FastAPI application and POST endpoint
- `pydantic`: Used for input and output model validation and serialization

# API Calls

The component itself does not make any external API calls. However, it does rely on the AbstractWorkflow's transform() method implementation, which may include external API calls as part of the image enhancement process.

# Error Handling

In the event of errors, the component relies on the default error handling provided by the parent AbstractWorkflow class. No specific error handling is implemented within the `ImageQualityEnhancer` class.

# Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `ImageQualityEnhancer` component within a Yeager Workflow:
