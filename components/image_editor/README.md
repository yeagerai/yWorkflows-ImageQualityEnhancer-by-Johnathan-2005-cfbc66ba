# Component Name: ImageEditor

## Description

ImageEditor is a component designed to edit an input image based on a list of suggested edits. The component processes the input image, applies the requested edits, and returns the enhanced image with its filename and file format.

## Input and Output Models

This component uses three data models:

1. `Edit`: Represents a single edit operation, consisting of an `operation` (a string) and a `value` (also a string).
2. `ImageEditorInputDict`: A Pydantic-based input data model containing two fields:
    - `input_image` (a string): The input image to be edited.
    - `suggested_edits` (a list of `Edit` objects): A list of suggested edits to be applied to the input image.
3. `ImageEditorOutputDict`: A Pydantic-based output data model containing three fields:
    - `enhanced_image` (a string): The edited image data.
    - `filename` (a string): The filename of the edited image.
    - `file_format` (a string): The file format of the edited image (e.g., "png").

These models are used to validate and serialize input and output data for the component.

## Parameters

The ImageEditor component's only parameter is `args` (of type `ImageEditorInputDict`), which is passed to the `transform` function.

## Transform Function

The `transform` function works as follows:

1. Initialization of an image editing library and any other necessary preparations.
2. Processing of the `input_image` and `suggested_edits`, applying the edits to the image.
3. Extraction of the filename and file format after the image is edited.
4. Return an `ImageEditorOutputDict` with the `enhanced_image`, `filename`, and `file_format`.

## External Dependencies

ImageEditor relies on the FastAPI library for creating the FastAPI application and the Pydantic library for creating input and output models. The actual implementation should include an appropriate image editing library for processing the input image.

## API Calls

No external API calls are made in this example implementation. However, if required, any external API calls should be documented here.

## Error Handling

Error handling is not covered in this example implementation, but appropriate error handling should be added when implementing the actual image editing functionality, including catching any exceptions and returning meaningful error messages.

## Examples

To use this ImageEditor component within a Yeager Workflow, you can do the following:

1. Import the `ImageEditor` component and create an instance:
